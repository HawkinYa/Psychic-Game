<!-- all pseudo code will be here on this html doc -->
<!-- the biggest thing i could do yet was have the computer keep its chosen letter until you run out of guesses -->
<!-- also i waasnt sure how to implement a solid solution to listing how many guesses were left or which geuesses were wrogn and would be listed out-->
<!-- the css is too boring and i wanted to make it spicy -->
<!-- and the javascript needs to be cleaner and more organized -->
